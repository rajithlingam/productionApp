## Features

### Parcel Setup

## State Management with Redux Toolkit
1. Install `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux`.
2. Build a store and connect it to the app.
3. Define slices (e.g., `cartSlice`).
4. Dispatch actions to update the state.
5. Use selectors to retrieve state data.

## Testing in React

### Types of Testing:
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components or functions.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the interaction between components.
3. **End-to-End (e2e) Testing**: Test the full workflow of the app.

### Setting Up Testing:
1. Install React Testing Library, Jest, and Babel dependencies.
2. Configure Babel and Parcel for testing.
3. Initialize Jest with `npx jest --init`.
4. Install `jsdom` and `@babel/preset-react` for JSX support.
5. Add `@testing-library/jest-dom` for extended DOM assertions.
